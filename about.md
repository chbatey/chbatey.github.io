Over the last 15 years I've worked as a software engineer, a consultant, and delivered training.
I am currently employed by Lightbend where I work on building the [Akka toolkit](https://akka.io/).

I've built systems with a range of technologies such as:

* Apache Cassandra
* Akka
* Kubernetes and Docker

I'm passionate about my work and particularly enjoy studying program languages, 
asynchronous programming, and distributed systems.
