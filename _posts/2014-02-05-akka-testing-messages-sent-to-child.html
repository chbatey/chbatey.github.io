I previously blogged about <a
        href="http://christopher-batey.blogspot.ca/2014/01/akka-testing-that-actor-sends-message.html" target="_blank">testing
    messages sent back to the
    sender</a>. Another common scenario is testing that an actor sends the correct message to a child. A piece of code that does this might look like:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/8834575.js"></script> But how do you test drive this kind of code? <br/>
<br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/8834631.js"></script> I've adopted the approach of removing the responsibility of creating the child from the ParentActor. To do this you can pass in a factory to the ParentActor's constructor that can be replaced for testing. To do this the ParentActor is changed to look like this:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/8834715.js"></script> The ParentActor now takes in a factory function which takes in an ActorFactoryRef and returns a ActorRef. This function is responsible for creating the ChildActor.
<br/><br/><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">childFactory: (ActorRefFactory) =&gt; ActorRef</span>
<br/><br/>This is then used by the ParentActor as follows:<br/><br/><span
        style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">val childActor = childFactory(context)</span>
<br/><br/>You can now inject a TestProbe for testing rather than using a real ActorFactorRef. For example:<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/8834924.js"></script>And for the real code you can pass in an anonymous function that uses the ActorRefFactory to actually create a real ChildActor:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/8834998.js"></script> Here you can see the ActorFactoryRef (context in Actors implement this interface) is used to create an Actor the same way as the original ParentActor did.
