I work across a desktop and two laptops so reproducible builds mean a lot to me! I often slate Gradle for being buggy and not doing the simple things well (e.g. dependency management for local development).

<br/>
<br/>However it is awesome when you want a quick bit of build logic. I wanted to build my schema for a Cassandra application I am working on to keep my various machines up to date.
<br/>
<br/>So easy in an extensible system like Gradle. I already had my schema creation commands in src/main/resources/schema/tables.cql
<br/><br/>I then added a built script dependency to my build.gradle:<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/ce468dc108091e0e056b.js"></script>
<br/>Then added a few imports and a couple of nifty tasks:<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/f3fcfb7bbd928c1ece11.js"></script>
<br/>Of course this relies on one CQL command per line and isn't exactly liquabase but not bad for 10 minutes hacking.
<br/><br/>Lots of these hacks can lead to very ugly build scripts so be careful :)
