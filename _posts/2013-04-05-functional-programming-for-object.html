The first section of this book introduces you to Clojure - mainly how the read evaluate and print processing works.<br/>
<br/>You're introduced to:<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Defining functions</li>
    <li>Built in functions such as nth</li>
    <li>Naming things such as functions and values</li>
    <li>Lists</li>
</ul>
<div>The exercises are to define a function that returns the second element in a list and at least a couple of
    implementations of a function that returns the third element in the list.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Here are my implementations of second:</div>
<div><br/>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/5317208.js"></script>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And here are my implementations of third:</div><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/84b5df733d186e1e3bf9.js"></script> I've used the inbuilt functions nth, first, rest and done an implementation of third that uses one of my implementations of second.
