My train was cancelled today and as I am trying to cement my knowledge of python &nbsp;I decided to do mergesort in python from memory. I find when adding new languages to my toolkit It is easy to forget how to setup a quick project with unit tests so I find it useful to do regular little projects from scratch Here's the code:

<br/>&nbsp;And hear's the unit tests (of course the unit tests came first!):<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/5978758.js"></script> I really like python and its unit testing framework. So simple to get going and for doing TDD.
