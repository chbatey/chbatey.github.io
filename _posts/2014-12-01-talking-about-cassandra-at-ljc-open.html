The <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ljcopenconference/" target="_blank">LJC
    conference</a> is a yearly event for Java/JVM developers in London to get together and see some (hopefully) great talks :)

<br/><br/>IBM kindly provide the an awesome venue on South Bank at no charge.<br/>
<br/>I had the fortune of being scheduled to talk first which means I could get my talk done and then enjoy the rest of the day. I chose to speak about Cassandra for Java devs which went down really well and I had people coming to me all day asking about Cassandra.
<br/><br/>Here are the slides:<br/><br/>
