Recently I was writing integration tests for a library that returned futures. I wanted simple synchronous tests.<br/>
<br/>Fortunately in the latest release of ScalaTest they have added something to do just that: the ScalaFutures trait
<br/><br/>Say you have a class that returns a Future, e.g:<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/8853877.js"></script> And you want to write a test for this and you want to wait for the future to complete. In regular code you might use a call back or a for comprehension e.g:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/8853910.js"></script>
<br/>This won't work in a test as the test will finish before the future completes and the assertions are on a different thread.
<br/>
<br/>ScalaFutures to the rescue! Upgrade to ScalaTest 2.0+ and mix in the ScalaFutures trait. Now you can test using whenReady:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/8853955.js"></script> Or with futureValue: <br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/8853965.js"></script> Happy testing! <a
