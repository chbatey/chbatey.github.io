Cassandra and MongoDB are two of the more popular NoSQL databases. I've been using Cassandra extensively over the past 6 months and I've recently started using MongoDB. Here is a brief description of the two, I'll follow up this post with a deeper comparison of the more advanced features.
<br/><br/><h3>Cassandra</h3>
<div>Cassandra was originally created by Facebook and is written in Java, however it is now a Apache project.
    Traditionally Cassandra can be thought of as a column orientated database or a row orientated database depending on
    how you use columns. Each row is uniquely identified by a row key, like a primary key in a relational database.
    Unlike a relational database each row can have a different set of columns and it is common to use both the column
    name and the column value to store data. Rows are contained bya &nbsp;column family which can be thought of as a
    table.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Client's use the thrift transport protocol and queries look like:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
    <pre style="background-color: #f3f5f7; border: 1pt solid rgb(174, 189, 204); font-family: courier, monospace; padding: 5pt; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;"><span
            style="font-size: x-small;">set Person['chbatey']['fname'] = 'Chris Batey';</span></pre>
</div>
<br/>Where Person is the column family, chbatey is the row key, fname is the column name and "Chris Batey" is the column value. Column names are dynamic so a client can store any key/value pairs. In this sense Cassandra is quite schemaless.
<br/>
<br/>Then came Cassandra 1.* and CQL 3. Cassandra Query Language (CQL) is a SQL like language for Cassandra. Suddenly Cassandra, from a client's perspective, become much more like a relational database. Queries now look like this:
<br/><br/>
<div>
    <pre style="background-color: #f3f5f7; border: 1pt solid rgb(174, 189, 204); font-family: courier, monospace; padding: 5pt; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;"><span
            style="font-size: x-small;">insert into Person(fname) values ('chbatey')</span></pre>
</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">Using CQL3 there are no more dynamic column names and you create tables rather than column families (however the map type basically gives the same functionality). It's all still column families under the covers, CQL3 is just a very nice abstraction (a simplification).&nbsp;</span>
</div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span
        style="font-size: small;">Cassandra appears to be moving away from a thrift protocol and moving to a&nbsp;</span>proprietary<span
        style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;protocol referred to as a native protocol.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><br/></span></div>
<div>Overall Cassandra is quite a "rough around the edges" database to use (less so with CQL3) from a client
    perspective. It's real power comes from its horizontal scalability and tuneable eventual consistency. More on this
    in a future post.<br/><br/></div><h3></h3><h3>MongoDB</h3>
<div>MongoDB is a document database written in C++. Document databases are very intuitive as you simply store and
    retrieve documents! No crazy data model to learn, for MongoDB you simply store and retrieve JSON (BSON) objects.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Storing looks like this:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
    <div>
        <pre style="background-color: #f3f5f7; border: 1pt solid rgb(174, 189, 204); font-family: courier, monospace; padding: 5pt; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;"><span
                style="font-size: x-small;">db.people.save({_id: 'chbatey', fname:'Chris Batey'})</span></pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 16px;">Retrieving looks like this:</span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
    <pre style="background-color: #f3f5f7; border: 1pt solid rgb(174, 189, 204); font-family: courier, monospace; padding: 5pt; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;"><span
            style="font-size: x-small;">db.people.find({_id: 'chbatey'})</span></pre>
</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br/></span></div>
<div>Simple!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>MongoDB has a very rich JSON based querying language and a fantastic aggregation framework. From a client's
    perspective MongoDB is a vastly more featured database with support for ad-hoc querying (Cassandra you must index
    everything you want to search by).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br/></div><h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div>This post was a very brief description of Cassandra and MongoDB. In future posts I will compare:</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Fault tolerance - replication</li>
        <li>Read and write consistency</li>
        <li>Clients</li>
        <li>Hadoop support</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Particularly for Cassandra it is very important how your data centre and Cassandra cluster are laid out as to
        which read and write consistency levels you need to get the desired behaviour.&nbsp;</div>
