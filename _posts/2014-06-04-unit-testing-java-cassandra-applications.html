I often get asked what is the best method for unit and and integration testing Java code that communicates with Cassandra.
<br/><br/>Here are what I think the options are:<br/>
<ol>
    <li>Mocking libraries: Use mocking libraries such as Mockito to mock out the driver you are using</li>
    <li>Cassandra Unit</li>
    <li>Integration test the class in question with against a real Cassandra instance running locally</li>
    <li>Stubbed Cassandra (disclaimer: I made this)</li>
</ol>Lets take these one by one and look at their respective advantages and disadvantages. The things to consider are:
<br/>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Speed of the tests</li>
        <li>Able to run the tests concurrently and how easy this is to achieve</li>
        <li>Able to test everything? Even failures?</li>
        <li>Are the tests brittle?</li>
        <li>Readability of the tests</li>
        <li>Requirements on environment e.g do you need a Cassandra instance installed?</li>
        <li>Confidence it will work against a real Cassandra</li>
        <li>Subjective nonsense by writer of this blog</li>
    </ul>
</div><h4>1 Mock the library</h4>
<div><br/>You can use a combination of factories and mocking to stop the driver actually interacting with Cassandra.
    Then verify your code's interactions with these mocks.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Advantages:</b></div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Fast - no I/O</li>
        <li>Execute tests concurrently</li>
        <li>No Cassandra instance required on machine your code compile runs</li>
        <li>Can test everything including the various failures as you can mock the library to throw ReadTimeout
            exceptions etc
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div><b>Disadvantages:</b></div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>You may mock the driver to behave in a different way to how it will behave&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Very hard to understand tests due to large amount of boiler plate mocking code</li>
        <li>Very brittle tests. Change your driver, change your tests! Change from a query to a prepared statement,
            change your tests!
        </li>
        <li>A lot of boiler plate. Take the Datstax driver for example, it returns a ResultSet, which is iterable, fancy
            writing the code that mocks it returning many results?
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div><b>Conclusion:</b></div>
</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't do it if you wish to remain sane</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2 Cassandra Unit</h4></div>
<div><br/>Cassandra Unit is a tool for starting an embedded Cassandra in the JVM your tests are running. It also has a
    great API for ingesting data into Cassandra for your tests.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Advantages</b>:</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Pretty fast. It is all in process.</li>
        <li>Can run tests concurrently if they use different keyspaces and none of the tests turn it off etc</li>
        <li>Can use CQL to load data as it is a real Cassandra. I think this leads to readable tests</li>
        <li>No Cassandra required on machine. Can use the it via a Maven dependency</li>
        <li>High confidence your code will work against a real Cassandra&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Disadvantages</b>:</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Unable to test failure scenarios. What is a read time out when there is only one node running in the same
            JVM as your test?
        </li>
        <li>No way to verify consistency of queries</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Conclusion</b>:</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Very useful tool for in process happy path tests</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <div><h4><br/></h4><h4>3 Integration style tests using a real Cassandra</h4></div>
    <div><br/>This is something I've done a lot of recently. Every dev machine at my current work place has a Cassandra
        instance running (using the awesome tool ccm). Then we test our DAOs by assuming it is there and doing testing
        in a dynamic keyspace.
    </div>
    <div><br/></div>
    <div><b>Advantages</b>:</div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Can run tests concurrently if they use different keyspaces and none of the tests turn it off etc</li>
            <li>Tests aren't brittle, can change from queries to prepared statements, or the queries involved without
                changing tests
            </li>
            <li>Readable tests - all data setup is done in CQL</li>
            <li>Very high confidence it will work against a real Cassandra as the test is against a &nbsp;real Cassandra
                :)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div><b>Disadvantages</b>:</div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Probably the slowest option. But it is still millisecond quick.</li>
            <li>Hard to test scenarios other than turning the node off. This then makes the tests slow.</li>
            <li>Cassandra required to build and run tests</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div><b>Conclusion</b>:</div>
</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Slightly slower but very useful for testing happy paths</li>
        <li>Very similar to using Cassandra unit</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <div><h4>4 Stubbed Cassandra</h4></div>
    <div><br/>Stubbed Cassandra is a new open source tool that pretends to be Cassandra and can be primed to returns
        rows, read timeouts, write timeouts and unavailable errors. It can be used via a maven dependency or as a
        standalone server.
    </div>
    <div><br/></div>
    <div><b>Advantages</b>:</div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Very fast</li>
            <li>Can test all types of errors and be confident in what the driver does as the driver thinks it is a real
                Cassandra
            </li>
            <li>Can run many instances inside the same JVM listening on different binary ports. So can run tests
                concurrently with no extra effort e.g no requirement to use different keyspaces
            </li>
            <li>Tests less brittle than mocking the driver. Can change driver without changing test but if you change
                queries you need to update your priming
            </li>
            <li>No requirement to have a real Cassandra. Just brought in by a maven dependency</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div><b>Disadvantages</b>:</div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Slightly more brittle than a real Cassandra/Cassandra unit. Requires priming on the query, priming for
                each prepared statement
            </li>
            <li>Slightly less confidence it will work against a real Cassandra as it isn't a real Cassandra. But more
                confidence than mocking
            </li>
            <li>It is new and does not support all of Cassandra's features, so if you use a feature that Scassandra
                doesn't support you are stuck!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div><br/></div>
    <div><b>Conclusion</b>:</div>
</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Best solution for all error case testing</li>
        <li>Best solution if you need to execute tests concurrently</li>
    </ul>
</div>
