Had a great time giving a talk on building fault tolerant micro services at skills matter this week. It was great to share some of the good work my team and I have been doing at BSkyB.  Here are the slides:

        style="border-width: 1px; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" width="425"></iframe>

<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a

<br/>Skills matter were kind enough to record the event, here is the video:&nbsp;<a

<br/>I referenced some great tools such as wiremock and saboteur and coincidentally the author was in the audience, it is a small tech world we live in!
