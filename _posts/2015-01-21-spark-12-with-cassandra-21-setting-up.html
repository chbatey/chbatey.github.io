In my <a href="http://christopher-batey.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/getting-started-cassandra-spark-with.html"
         target="_blank">previous post on Cassandra and
    Spark</a> I showed how to get a development environment setup with Vagrant/Ansible/VirtualBox without installing Cassandra/Spark on your dev station.

<br/>
<br/>This update will get us to a point where we can run SQL (yes, SQL, not CQL) on Cassandra. It is just a trivial example to show the setup working.
<br/>
<br/>The previous article was back in the days of Spark 1.0. With Spark 1.1+ we can now run SparkSQL directly against Cassandra.
<br/><br/>I've updated the <a href="https://github.com/chbatey/vagrant-cassandra-spark" target="_blank">Vagrant/Ansible
    provisioning</a> to install Spark 1.2 and Cassandra 2.1, and I've added a new "fatjar" with the latest Cassandra Spark connector so that we can use it in the Spark shell and show this magic working. The 1.2 connector isn't released yet so I have built against the Alpha, see
<a href="https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector" target="_blank">here for
    details</a>. We're just that cutting edge here...<br/>
<br/>So, once you have ran vagrant up (this will take a while as it downloads&nbsp;+ install all of the above) you'll need to SSH in we can get into Spark shell.
<br/><br/>I've setup the following alias so no worrying about classpaths:<br/><br/><b>alias spark-shell='spark-shell
    --jars /vagrant/spark-connector-1.2.0-alpha1-driver-2.1.4-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar</b><br/>
<br/>First lets jump into cqlsh and create a keyspace and table to play with:<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/a58d40b801e587a053c2.js"></script>
<br/>Not the most exciting schema you'll ever see, but this is all about getting the Hello World of SparkSQL on Cassandra working!
<br/><br/>Now we have some data to play with lets access it from Spark shell.<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/be40894a5f8a6fed582d.js"></script>
<br/>Lets go through what has happened here:<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Lines 3-6: Mandatory Spark ASCII art</li>
    <li>Line 12: Import the connector so we can access Cassandra</li>
    <li>Line 15: Create a CassandraSQLContext</li>
    <li>Line 18: Set it to our test Keyspace we created above</li>
    <li>Line 20: Select the whole table (very exciting I know!)</li>
    <li>Line 21: Get Spark to execute an action so all the magic happens</li>
</ul><br/>That's all for now, tune in later for a more complicated example :)<br/>
<br/>Here's the link to all the Vagrant/Ansible&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/chbatey/vagrant-cassandra-spark"
