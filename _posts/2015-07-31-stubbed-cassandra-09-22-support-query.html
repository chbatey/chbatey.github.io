Version 0.9.1 has a few nice features and has reduced a lot of technical debt. The first features aren't that noticeable from a users point of view:
<br/><br/><b>Java 1.6
    support</b>! This was contributed by Andrew Tolbert as he wanted to test against the 1.* branch of the C* Java driver which still supports Java 1.6. I hadn't intentionally dropped 1.6 support but I had brought in a jar that was compiled against 1.7 and thus wouldn't run in a 1.6 JVM. The offending jar was an internal C* jar that could help with serialisation so it was quite a lot of work to replace the use of this jar with custom serialisation code.
<br/>
<br/>Another non-feature feature: Moving to Gradle and having a single build for the Server, Java client and Integration tests against all the versions of the C* Java driver. The aim of this was to make it MUCH easier for other people to contribute as before you had to install the server to a maven repo, then build the client and install it, then run the tests. Now you just run: ./gradlew clean check, Simples.
<br/><br/><h3>Real features</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Verification of batch statements containing queries. Priming and prepared statements in batches will be in the next
    release.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Support for version 2.2 of the C* driver.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Verification of the prepare of prepared statements. This will allow you to test you only prepare the statements
    once and at the right time i.e. application start up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Queries that contain variables are now captured properly. As of C* 2.0 you can use a prepared statement like syntax
    for queries and pass in variables. These are now captured as long as you primed the types of the variables (so
    Stubbed Cassandra knows how to parse them).
</div>
<div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"/>A farJar task so you build a standalone executable. Useful if you aren't
    using Stubbed Cassandra from a build tool like maven.<br/><br/></div>
<div>As always please raise issues or reach out to be on twitter if you have any questions or feedback.</div>
