Day two is all about collections. Forcing the typical Java developer (me) to think about iteration in a different way.<br /><br />Exercise 1 is to take a List of strings and add up the number of characters using the fold left function. There is a very similar example in the book so I think the author is just checking you are paying attention:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/5317239.js"></script> Exercise 2 introduces you to Traits by asking you to develop a trait that has a method which censors a string by substituting words in a string. The words to substitute and what to substitute them with should be stored in a Map.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/5317253.js"></script> <br />Then create a version that loads the substitutions from a file:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/chbatey/5317264.js"></script> I chose to extend the trait and populate the alternatives field. Spending all my days writing Java what I ended up producing looks very alien to me. It works (I think) something like this:   <br /><br /><ul><li>Open and read a file using the library method fromFile</li><li>Get the lines of the file one by one using getLines</li><li>Map each like to an Array by splitting the like with the = sign (the file is key value pairs like a Java properties file)</li><li>Map the array to a tuple then turn it into a list</li><li>Construct a map from the List of tuples</li></ul><div>And done! Looks a lot nicer than it sounds! The full source code is available on my github.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
