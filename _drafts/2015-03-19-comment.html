I've found it very useful recently to start documenting APIs in an automated fashion. This is of course useful for colleagues and future developers but even my self, moving between projects frequently often leaves me forgetting the exact details of the APIs I've made.<br /><br />I have no interest in doing this manually, sound boring and easy to get out of date. Swagger to the rescue http://swagger.io/.<br /><br /><br />
