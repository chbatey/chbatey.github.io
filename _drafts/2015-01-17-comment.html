Yesterday I decided that I'd like to give back to the OpenJDK, Mani and Daniel from the LJC gave a lightning talk at the latest LJC Open Conference and they have inspired me!<br /><br />So here's my first hour trying to work out how to get involved..<br /><br />So my first google for me to the OpenJDK website:&nbsp;<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/guide/repositories.html">http://openjdk.java.net/guide/repositories.html</a><br /><br />I'm on a mac and have I've never used mercurial so had to install it, brew to the rescue!<br /><br />I then followed the guide for installing the trees extension for mercurial:&nbsp;<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/">http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/</a><br /><br />This allowed me to check the whole jdk 9 development branch out:<br /><br /><b>hg tclone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev 9dev</b><br /><br />I am currently visiting family in the country with very slow internet so this checkout took about 1 hour (I didn't include that in my first hour with the OpenJDK).<br /><br />Then from the following page I learn the nifty commands for status, checking incoming changes and checking any outgoing changes:&nbsp;<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/">http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/</a><br /><br />So now I have the Open JDK checked out, I quickly found a very useful file called:&nbsp;README-builds.html I won't replicate any of that here as it will soon get out of date.<br /><br /><br />
