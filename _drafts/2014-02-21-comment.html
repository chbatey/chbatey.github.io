So you've been doing Java for years and suddenly it all changes with Java8. Here's some of the new lingo you'll here.<br /><br />Functional Interface: This is an interface with a single method. Also know as a Single Abstract Method type. There are many examples in the standard API, e.g. Runnable, ActionListener and Comparator.<br /><br />Lambda expression: This is the new syntax for defining anonymous functions something which Java has needed for a long time e.g.<br /><br />// Include Lambda code here.
