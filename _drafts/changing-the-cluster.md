There are many changes you might want to make to your cluster:

* [Replace a node](/cassandra-replacing-a-node.html)
* [Add a Data Center](/cassandra-adding-a-dc.html)
* [Scale a node in size](/cassandra-scaling-up.html)
* [Add nodes to an existing DC](/cassandra-adding-nodes)
* [Upgrade the version of Cassandra](/cassandra-upgrading.html)
