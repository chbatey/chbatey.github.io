I got chatting to someone at NYC Cassandra day about bi-temporal data and didn't get to finish the conversation. I don't pretend to remember the actual use case / specifics but it came down to a time series problem where there are multiple time stamps associated with a stream of events. Cassandra is obviously awesome at time series data with a single timestamp as you use that timestamp as part of your clustering columns and you get sequential ordering on disk, but what about multiple?<br /><br />Scenario A<br /><br />I have an option to buy something from time X to time Y, find all the things I can buy at time Z.<br /><br />
