Lets say that you have a new project, it is a set of services that can be used via REST.<br /><br /><b>Decision: Language?</b><br /><br />This article will be about Java. So what's the perfect continuous delivery pipeline?<br /><br /><b>Decision: To container or not to contain?</b><br /><br />Lets decide we want to be nice to our ops team. Lets produce an executable jar rather than have them install tomcat on all their boxes.<br /><br /><b>Decision: How to build an executable jar?</b><br /><br /><b>Decision: Build tool?</b><br /><br />Maven, Gradle, Ant?<br /><br />Having spent the last year using Gradle, I've slowly come to the conclusion that Maven works better, there is more documentation, even if that documentation is answers on StackOverflow.<br /><br /><b>Decision: Version control?</b><br /><br /><br />
