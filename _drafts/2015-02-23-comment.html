This is a series of posts building on my experiences build horizontally scalable APIs in Java using Spring boot and Cassandra as the Database.<br /><br />As my old companies aren't going to let me take the applications I built their as a example I am slowly building an example auction site, like Ebay.<br /><br />Here are the article:<br /><br /><ol><li>Security - using Cassandra as a user store</li><li>Metrics - monitoring the application and its connectivity to Cassandra</li><li>Logs - pushing to Logstash/Elastic search</li><li>Dealing with Cassandra failure</li><li>Data modelling for high throughput reads and writes</li></ol>
